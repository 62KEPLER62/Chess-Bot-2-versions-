# Chess-Bot-2-versions-
Chess bot with two versions (javascript, all codes in one file)
I have been working for javascript for a while and I made this chess bot with 2 versions. First one looks for next 3 moves and more stable, the second one looks for the next 4 moves but it is not very stable and can be improved. All the code of this project is in one file (index.html).

I tried to used minimax algorithm in this bot.
Graphics of the bot is made with html, javascirpt and css.
On top of the website you can see how many moves have the bot calculated.
